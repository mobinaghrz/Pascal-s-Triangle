# Khayyam-pascal-triangle
The idea here is that we put the whole triangle in a line,
we skip lines one and two  and print them right away,
then for the res,t we put a pointer that sums the two up numbers in the middle number.

Linear Solution for Khayyam Pascal Triangle.py
 The algorithm in this file is to put the whole lines before in a linear list calculate the entire triangle in a list, and afterward print it in a triangle


 Nth line of the Pascal triangle.py
 it goes with the formula:
 for N th line :

N! / K! * (N-K)! 

Note: K is the choise from N.
